This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a small experiment to learn about project m36.

Right now the websocket connection is hard coded to `wss://try.project-m36.io/ws/`;

The websocket connection does drop a lot.  Right now you have to
refresh the page to reconnect.
